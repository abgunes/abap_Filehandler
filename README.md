# abap_Filehandler
Construction to handle Files in ABAP

The classes are designed to handle any kind of incoming file. Either from the frontend server or the sap Server. The goal is to implement a Coding in which the developer has not to care about if it's a UTF-16 BE flatfile or a binary.

Next steps are:
* The classes were designed for a 7.00 Kernel. They will be changed to 7.5X Syntax
* Implement the (SAP Standard) Authorization
* Implement a codepage conversion for both
* (?)Implement FTP Access

>Lets see how far we can get :)
