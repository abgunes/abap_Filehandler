# abap_Filehandler
Construction to handle Files in ABAP

The classes are designed to handle any kind of incoming/outgoing file. Either from the frontend server or the application server. The goal is to implement a Coding in which the developer has not to care about if it's a UTF-16 BE flatfile or a binary and if its on application server or on the frontend server.

Next steps are:
* The classes were designed for a 7.00 Kernel. They will be changed to 7.5X Syntax
* Implement the (SAP Standard) Authorization
* Implement a codepage conversion for both
* (?)Implement FTP Access

>Lets see how far we can get :)
